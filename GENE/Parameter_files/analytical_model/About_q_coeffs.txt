The analytical model can be calculated by the script:0make_GENE_profiles_max.py from https://github.com/maxcurie1996/mode_finder 
q coeffs [real(6) 0.0]: global code specific real valued array which specifies the safety factor profile as polynomial function up to 5th order.
The first element is the coefficient of the x0 term, the second element
is the coefficient of the linear term, and so on. Currently only available in the circular equilibrium. The sign of the safety factor profile
will be adjusted to be consisted with toroidal field and plasma current
orientation.
